"""Pillow decode fallback for stills Qt cannot decode (fauxcasa-v46.4).

The pinned PySide6 build ships no PSD image plugin, so a .psd file in
the walk (§5 stills matrix) would always error-tile through the Qt-only
decode paths. Pillow's PsdImagePlugin reads the FLATTENED COMPOSITE —
the Picasa-equivalent behavior: only PSDs saved with Photoshop's
"maximize compatibility" carry one, and a PSD without it legitimately
error-tiles (there is nothing composed to show).

The seam is generic, not PSD-gated: callers try QImageReader first and
hand the SAME bytes here only when Qt yielded a null image, so any
still Qt's plugins reject (exotic JPEG variants, 16-bit TIFF flavors)
gets one Pillow attempt before the error tile. Extension-routed RAW and
video files never reach this fallback — rawload/videoload route them
BEFORE Qt can sniff the bytes (rawload module doc), and their branches
never fall through here, so a TIFF-based RAW container can't be
"rescued" into a garbled preview by PIL either.

Orientation is applied exactly once per path, like rawload: Qt's path
uses setAutoTransform; this path bakes the tag via PIL's exif_transpose
(a no-op for untagged formats — PSD carries no EXIF Orientation). The
two paths are alternatives, never composed.

Threat-model note (docs/decode-threat-model.md): in-process like all
tracer decode, but a single bytes-in/pixels-out function so the future
sandboxed decode service slots in behind the same seam. Fail-soft:
Pillow missing, unreadable bytes, truncated planes — all return a null
QImage (error tile), never an exception.
